          <h2>Darren and Chris Oilund</h2>
          <p class="mb-2 font-light lg:mb-6">
            Thank you for checking out our Bio for Cape Energy Group Inc. We are glad you are here and would like to
            share a bit of our story. I, Darren Oilund, was born and raised in the Grande Prairie, AB and the Peace
            Country has always been home. My wife Chris Oilund is originally from Saskatchewan and has lived in Grande
            Prairie since the 1980's.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-light lg:mb-6">
            Prior to Cape Energy Group Inc., we owned and operated an industrial medical and H2S safety company named
            Cloak Medic and Safety Services from 2003 to 2018. In 2018 we had the opportunity to sell, and we thought we
            would explore other opportunities. Little did we know how much we would miss the industry that we were so
            much a part of for 15 years. Over the last few years, we have run into former employees who still to this
            day refer to themselves as part of the “Cloak” family. The other question they had for us, “when are you
            going to start up another company?” These conversations resonated with us and the fact that we really did
            miss the industry gave us thoughts to ponder regarding starting another company in the H2S Safety space.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-light lg:mb-6">
            From the beginning we have always focused on creating value in the people's lives who join our team. We
            believe everyone should look forward coming to work each day, enjoying the people we work with. One of our
            core believes is creating value in people, when they see their own value they become the best version of
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-light lg:mb-6">
            We are back doing what we love and our core offering is H2S safety services where we have put together the
            latest technology in our gear and new innovative technology in our electronics. We have not come back to the
            oil and gas industry to merely exist, we have come back to thrive in every way!
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-light lg:mb-6">
            We have missed all of you and we are so grateful to be back serving people and this incredible energy
            industry. Lastly, we have had questions regarding the name “Cape” and why we chose this name. Our old
            company was “Cloak.” We do not wear a “Cloak” anymore, when you find your superpowers, you wear a Cape.
